# Student Loan Recommendation System

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based recommendation system to help students find suitable loan options based on their academic, financial, and personal profiles. By analyzing various data, including academic performance, family income, health considerations, and financial background, the system generates personalized loan recommendations to support students in continuing their education without financial strain.

## Project Overview

The Student Loan Recommendation System takes into account:
- **Academic Data**: GPA, degree type, major, and school ranking
- **Financial Data**: Income level, current debts, family income, and expected post-graduation salary
- **Health Data**: Physical and mental health factors that may affect academic performance
- **Loan Product Data**: Interest rates, repayment terms, grace periods, and loan flexibility options

### Key Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailors loan suggestions based on each student’s unique financial and personal circumstances.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensures data privacy and security in line with best practices for handling sensitive information.
- **Accurate and Up-to-date Data**: Uses current and complete data to provide relevant loan options and avoid financial hardship.

## Recommendation System Design

The recommendation model employs **context-based filtering**, leveraging specific details about the student’s profile and context to suggest loans that best fit their individual needs. This approach allows for a flexible system that aligns with the diverse backgrounds of students.

## Real-World Challenges

1. **Privacy and Data Security**: Ensuring the protection of sensitive data (e.g., income, health, and academic records) to prevent unauthorized access and maintain students' trust.
2. **Data Accuracy and Completeness**: Guaranteeing that the data used in recommendations is accurate and up-to-date, as incomplete or outdated information can lead to poor loan choices and financial strain for students.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for model building and evaluation
- **scikit-learn** for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data handling
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional) for model experimentation and analysis

## Getting Started


It’s recommended to use **Google Colab** for this project, as it provides an easy environment to run Python code with access to powerful hardware (e.g., GPUs) and all necessary packages pre-installed.


### Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and preprocess data using provided scripts.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model with `train.py`, adjusting hyperparameters as necessary.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on test data to check accuracy and prediction quality.
4. **Prediction**: Use the model to generate loan recommendations for new student data.
